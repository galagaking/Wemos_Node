# Wemos_Node
WiFi localisation Node based on Wemos - RFM95 with Node-Red back-end
This repository contains the sketch and instructions for building a
LoRaWan node based on Wemos - RFM95. The node will 'listen' to surrounding
WiFi networks and sent the two strongest BSSID addresses to The Things Network.
In NodeRed 'Google geolocation services' is used to determine the position of
the node. At the end the location will be shown on 'WorldMap'.
Workshop was given at the first The Things Network conference on 1-3 February 2018
in Amsterdam
